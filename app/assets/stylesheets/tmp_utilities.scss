/**
 * DISCLAIMER
 * This is a temporary stylesheet meant to assist in migrating away from desktop-first responsive
 * CSS utilities.
 * DO NOT add utils in here unless you are actively taking part in in the migration.
 * We needed this new file for temporary utils to be defined _after_ the main, non-responsive
 * GitLab UI util.
 * This file is scheduled to be removed by the end of 2023.
