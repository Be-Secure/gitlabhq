  body: |
    The [`sidekiq['min_concurrency']` and `sidekiq['max_concurrency']`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/sidekiq/extra_sidekiq_processes.html#manage-thread-counts-explicitly) settings are deprecated in GitLab 16.9 and will be removed in GitLab 17.0.

    You can use `sidekiq['concurrency']` in GitLab 16.9 and later to set thread counts explicitly in each process.

    This change only applies to Linux package (Omnibus) installations.
