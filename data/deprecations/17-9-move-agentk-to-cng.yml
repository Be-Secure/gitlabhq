    We are moving the `agentk` container registry from [its project-specific registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/gitlab-agent/container_registry/1223205) to [the Cloud Native GitLab registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/CNG/container_registry/8241772).
    From GitLab 18.0, the project-specific registry will not receive `agentk` updates.
    If you mirror the `agentk` container to a local registry, you should change your mirror source to the CNG registry.

    If you use the official Helm charts, they will start deploying from the new location seamlessly.
