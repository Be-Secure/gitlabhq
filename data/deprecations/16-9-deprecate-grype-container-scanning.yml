    Support for the Grype scanner in the GitLab Container Scanning analyzer is deprecated in
    GitLab 16.9 and will be removed in GitLab 17.0.

    You should use the default setting for `CS_ANALYZER_IMAGE`, which uses the Trivy
    scanner.

    To continue to use Grype, see the [Security scanner integration documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/integrations/secure.html) to learn how to
    create your own integration with GitLab.
